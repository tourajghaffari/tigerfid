# Project plan — tigerfid

TigeRFID: the ActiveWave active-RFID system — boards, firmware and software
built from 2001 to 2013 — that Touraj Ghaffari's sons open-sourced under
Apache-2.0 in 2017–2018 (the dedication in `readme.md`), and its rebuild
from the ground up. The 2018 state is kept byte for byte at the annotated
tag `activewave-2018` (`f25ff13f3fb672d8ec91f1fadc8894d69f781ed6`) and its
GitHub release; nothing in the history is rewritten. Initiative 1 joined the
repo to the fleet and cleared the current tree for the rebuild (closed
2026-10-27; its record is in `docs/archives/project-plan-completed.md`); Initiative 2
is the design study, which decides the new system and ends in Omid's
decision sitting. Its close files the build: one Reader, one Field Generator
and three tags across two zones, which a complete beginner can follow on
Windows, macOS or Linux with free tools only (milestone 1, Initiative 2).
Everything in this plan is public, written for a stranger (CLAUDE.md
§ Writing in public).

**Provenance / re-review note:** this plan was born at adoption, not audited — authored 2026-10-26 by hub Story 243.1.2 per KB `new-repo-standard`'s authored-plan template, from the approved design spec (hub spec `2026-10-26-tigerfid-onboarding-design`, Omid 2026-10-26, hub PR #4355). No `/audit-project` run yet; the spec's decisions D1–D12 and calls C1–C11 are the re-review record until the first audit.

**Last staleness sweep:** 2026-10-26 (adopted this day — every pointer in
this plan was written against the state it cites; the first sweep proper is
the first sprint proposal's step 2, KB `plan-staleness-sweep`).

## Plan format

Three levels, fleet-standard:

## Initiative N: <name>
### Epic N.M: <name>
#### Story N.M.K: <name>

Completed stories are ticked ✅ DONE in place by the completing PR; the
physical cut to `docs/archives/project-plan-completed.md` happens at epic
close only, never per story — the close PR is the archival PR (the archival
clause; fleet convention, Omid 2026-07-07). Every epic ends with a
`Close out Epic N.M` story and has a manifest in `docs/close/` (KB
`epic-close-protocol`); the PR that edits an epic's stories updates its
manifest.

Sprint orchestration blocks (kept in this file while live) are cut the same
way once every leg story is ✅ DONE **and** the sprint's review has landed —
into the archive's `## Executed sprints` section, newest first, the heading
stamped `— ✅ EXECUTED (date)` plus an **Executed:**/**Reviewed:** record.
Keep that section above the first `## Initiative` block in the archive.

## ASK-OMID register

No open rows. A1, answered, moved to the archive with Initiative 1 (KB
`register-relocation-at-close`, 2026-10-27).

## Initiative 2: The design study

**Objective:** turn spec D1–D7 into a design a builder can execute, decided
bottom-up against three acceptance scenarios: a conference where every
attendee wears a tag and the software shows each person on the floorplan; a
hospital nursery where each baby's tag carries a temperature sensor, so
staff can find each baby and read the sensor remotely; and a warehouse
inventorying 100,000+ items in minutes. The study answers spec §3: the
requirements with numbers, how the original worked, the radio and location
architecture with its legality, the parts and free toolchains, the software
stack for Windows, macOS and Linux, and the tiered cost — then Omid's
decision sitting writes the rebuild's design spec in this repo (the tigerian
shape: a research initiative with the design sitting at its end). The
anti-goals bind every answer: nothing a beginner cannot build or debug, no
paid tool or single vendor's cloud, no medical claim, no transmitter a
beginner cannot legally run.
**Milestone 1 (filed by this study's close — spec §4):** a builder with no
experience follows `guides/` and ends with one Reader, one Field Generator
and a sealTag, a compactTag and a cardTag built; the host software running
on their own Windows, macOS or Linux machine; all three tags read together
(anti-collision); a tag carried between two zones, the move showing on the
floorplan; a tamper alarm and a temperature reading arriving; and a tag
paired with a person raising an alarm when it leaves without them. Every
shopping list is tiered (D7). Omid is the first builder (D9): milestone 1 is
accepted when he has built it from the guides, and the guides are revised
from what his build taught before anyone else is pointed at them.
**Done when:** Epic 2.1 is archived with close evidence (initiative-final —
Epic 2.1 is its only epic), and its close has filed the build initiatives.

### Epic 2.1: The study, the decision sitting and the rebuild spec

**Goal:** six study documents under `docs/study/`, each answering one part
of spec §3, then the decision sitting and the approved rebuild spec.
**Ordering:** 2.1.1 → 2.1.2 (Sprint 1 legs 4–5) → 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 → 2.1.5 →
2.1.6 → 2.1.7 → 2.1.8. Manifest: `docs/close/2.1.json` (born FAILING — every
deliverable is still to be written).
**Done when:** every tooth in `docs/close/2.1.json` passes from the repo root
and its prose checks are adjudicated.

#### Story 2.1.1: The requirements, from the three scenarios, with numbers — ✅ DONE (2026-10-27)

**Completed:** 2026-10-27 — tigerfid #14 (branch `story-2.1.1-requirements`).
**Outcome:** `docs/study/requirements.md` carries 27 numbers. They are the five measures for each of the three scenarios, plus each scenario's size as an assumption, and each has its reasoning and Omid's answer recorded first-hand beside it.
- **The answers.** The list went out after the session terminal's `date -u` read of 11:57:23Z, and his one-message answer came before the read of 12:05:05Z. He accepted 24 numbers as recommended and set three himself:
  - [3]: 1,000 tags/s per reader;
  - [12]: 100 tags/s in the nursery;
  - [13]: a nursery move shown within 5 s.
- **His question on [3]** ("Can we do that?") is answered in the document by the arithmetic, marked INFERRED. It needs a fast link with short replies and reader-assigned slots, or several channels per reader; the original's random delay cannot do it.
- **For Stories 2.1.3–2.1.4:** every input to the arithmetic is marked ASSUMED or INFERRED, for those stories to replace with real parts' figures.
- **The ground rules hold.** No datasheet figure is copied (spec Appendix B). The nursery is framed as finding tags and reading a sensor; every "medical" or "vital" mention is a negation (C8).
- **Story 2.1.3 answers first** the hardest pairing: [3]'s 1,000 replies a second against [2]'s 30 m with the tag worn.

**Story:** As the study, I want each scenario turned into measurable
requirements, so that every design option is judged against numbers, not
impressions.
**Context:** spec §3.1. A number for each of: indoor read range; tags per
second through anti-collision (the warehouse's 100,000+ items in minutes
implies hundreds per second — INFERRED from the arithmetic; the study sets
the number); zone accuracy; alarm latency for tamper, temperature, missed
check-in and pairing; battery life. Each number is put to Omid and his
answer recorded beside it. The old datasheets' figures conflict with each
other (spec Appendix B) and are never copied as requirements. The nursery
scenario proves "find each tag and read its temperature sensor" — never a
medical device or a monitor of vital signs (spec C8).
**Done when:** `docs/study/requirements.md` carries, per scenario, a number,
its reasoning and Omid's recorded answer for each of the five measures.

#### Story 2.1.2: How the original worked — ✅ DONE (2026-10-27)

**Completed:** 2026-10-27 — tigerfid #16 (branch `story-2.1.2-original-system`).
**Outcome:** `docs/study/original-system.md` describes the 2001–2013 system from its records at the tag `activewave-2018`: the radio link, the anti-collision scheme, the zone mechanism, the alarms and I/O, and the hardware of the Reader, the Field Generator and the three tags. Each claim cites the file it was read from or is marked INFERRED, and a script found all 208 of its quoted phrases in their sources.
- **Measured:** the packets' CRC is CRC-16/X.25. It matches the records' three test vectors and their `0xF0B8` residue.
- **No record states the radio's data rate**, its modulation or any tags-per-second figure. The requirements' 250 kbit/s stays ASSUMED, and the receiver's 330 kHz IF filter suggests the original ran slower (INFERRED).
- **Three corrections to the onboarding spec** (Context and Appendix B):
  - the compactTag is Tag 102; Tag 103 is the miniTag;
  - the Reader's radio is the Transceiver daughterboard;
  - the 2012 sealTag is an ISO 15693 logging seal with no active radio and no temperature sensor.
- **For Stories 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.7:** milestone 1's sealTag is therefore a new design. The document's last section says why: one core in a seal enclosure, per spec §3.7, is weighed by 2.1.4 and decided by 2.1.7.

**Story:** As the study, I want one written description of the 2001–2013
system, read from its own records, so that every option has a reference to
beat.
**Context:** spec §3.2 and Appendix B, read at the tag (or in the reference
folder): the protocol documents (`api/documents/Protocol20061015.doc`,
`Protocol-tg-07092008.doc`, `AW_API.pdf`, `AW_API_V39.doc`), the Reader 103
and Tag 103 schematics and BOMs, and the sealTag's STM8L firmware source —
the only firmware source in the tree (none exists for the Standard Reader
or the PIC tags). The two-way radio: the Reader or a Field Generator wakes
and commands tags at 433 MHz; tags reply at 916/927 MHz (US) or 868 MHz
(EU) with random-delay anti-collision; a zone is a Field Generator plus a
motion detector.
**Done when:** `docs/study/original-system.md` describes the radio link, the
anti-collision scheme, the zone mechanism, the alarms and I/O, and each
milestone device's hardware, citing for each claim the file at the tag it
was read from; a claim no record supports is marked INFERRED.

#### Story 2.1.3: Radio, location and legality

**Story:** As the study, I want the radio and location architecture chosen
against the scenarios, the law and a beginner's hands, so that the first
build is legal to run and possible to build.
**Context:** spec §3.3, §3.8 and C9. The options: a sub-GHz system-on-chip
in the original's split (a wake channel plus a reply channel); a
single-band design with wake-on-radio; dual-band chips (sub-GHz for
tracking, Bluetooth for phone setup); Bluetooth Long Range, LoRa and UWB as
comparisons. Pre-certified radio modules are preferred wherever they meet
the scenarios, so a beginner's build is legal without equipment
authorisation. The US rules (47 CFR Part 15 — §15.231 at 433 MHz, §15.249
and §15.247 in 902–928 MHz, §15.23 for home-built devices) and their EU
equivalent are verified before any radio is chosen. The Chorus comparison
(spec D12, §3.8), radio side: four layers (tags, readers, server,
dashboard) with "reader" an abstraction any device emitting the same event
schema can fill; simple readers and a smart server; three hardware tiers
(item tag, reusable badge or fob, combined sensor-and-reader); prototyping
on off-the-shelf modules; and, not to copy, a crowd-sourced reader network.
Each item is ADOPTED or DECLINED with its reason, and the study says whether
ActiveWave's room-level zones from a field generator, its relay outputs and
its wake-on-command still win. From the study's first two documents (the
Sprint 1 review, 2026-10-27): this story answers first [3]'s 1,000 tags/s
per reader against [2]'s 30 m with the tag worn, and meets [3] or brings it
back to Omid with its cost; it chooses reader-assigned slots, a faster link
or several channels for [3] and [21], designs how a zone move is noticed
within [13]'s 5 s, and takes from the chosen radio what no original record
states — the bit rate, modulation, output power, certification and the wake
signal's form (the Story 2.1.1 tick; `docs/study/requirements.md` § Ground
rules and items [3], [13] and [21]; `docs/study/original-system.md` § What
no record states).
**Done when:** `docs/study/radio-and-location.md` compares the options
against the requirements, cites each rule above, names the chosen
architecture, and answers its Chorus items one by one.

#### Story 2.1.4: Chips, modules and the free toolchains

**Story:** As a builder, I want each device's parts and its free firmware
toolchain named, so that I can buy, flash and debug them on my own machine.
**Context:** spec §3.4 and §3.7; D4 (KiCad 10 for the boards), D5
(Windows, macOS and Linux), and the anti-goals (no paid tool, no single
vendor's cloud). For each candidate chip or module: availability, a free
toolchain on all three platforms, a debugger a beginner can afford, and the
licence of any reference design (Story 1.1.4's lane). It weighs §3.7's
question — one electronics core in three enclosures (the seal, the fob, the
card) against three separate boards — a suggestion to weigh, not a
decision. The spec's §7 files §3.7 under 2.1.7: this story weighs it, and
2.1.7's decision sitting decides it. From the study's first two documents
(the Sprint 1 review, 2026-10-27): this story replaces the requirements'
ASSUMED cell, reply-cost and listening figures with the chosen parts'
datasheet figures, chooses for the warehouse item tag ([27]) between a slower
wake and a CR2450-size cell, and weighs milestone 1's sealTag as a new
design inside §3.7's question, because the 2012 sealTag is an ISO 15693
logging seal with no active radio (the Story 2.1.2 tick;
`docs/study/requirements.md` § The arithmetic and item [27];
`docs/study/original-system.md` § What this means for the study).
**Done when:** `docs/study/parts-and-toolchains.md` names the parts per
device, the toolchain per part with its install on each platform, and the
one-core-or-three answer with its reasons.

#### Story 2.1.5: The software stack

**Story:** As a user on any of the three platforms, I want the host
software's stack chosen, so that the floorplan, the alarms and pairing run
on my own machine without a vendor's cloud.
**Context:** spec §3.5, §3.8 and D5. The host runs on Windows, macOS and
Linux, local first (it works offline); the floorplan view; the alarms
(tamper, temperature, missed check-in, pairing); pairing people with
things; an open API. The Chorus comparison (spec D12, §3.8), software side:
an item-history timeline per tag (zones, times, sensor values); alarm rules
set on screen (temperature range, dwell, left a zone, tampered, missed
check-in); "find the nearest available X" by zone; a printed QR code and ID
on every tag, so pairing is scan-and-scan; view-only, time-limited share
links; and, not to copy, a cloud-only service, and free hardware plus a
subscription with printed battery labels. Each item is ADOPTED or DECLINED
with its reason, and the study says whether owned infrastructure with no
subscription and pairing people with things still win. From the study's
second document (the Sprint 1 review, 2026-10-27): this story reads the
original host applications' source, Smart Tracker and the Programming
Station, which Story 2.1.2 left for it (the Outlook message beside them stays
unread under `docs/reference-repos.md` reading rule 7), and, with Story
2.1.3, says whether the rebuild's seal keeps an HF interface for reading by
a phone (`docs/study/original-system.md` § The records read and § What this
means for the study).
**Done when:** `docs/study/software-stack.md` names the stack and why,
sketches the event schema the readers report (tag, reader, signal strength,
time, payload), and answers its Chorus items one by one.

#### Story 2.1.6: The tiered cost of milestone 1

**Story:** As a beginner, I want the first build priced in starter, advanced
and pro tiers, so that I can choose what to spend before I start.
**Context:** spec §3.6, D7 and D9. Priced per device (the Reader, the Field
Generator, the three tags); per build route (hand-solder, partly assembled,
fully assembled); per tool tier (starter, advanced, pro — several ways to
the same end, for example several soldering irons); and the bench D9 needs
(a tool tier plus a cheap radio receiver to see what the boards transmit).
Every price is dated. This is the rebuild's first real budget.
**Done when:** `docs/study/tiered-cost.md` carries the tables with a date on
every price and a total per tier.

#### Story 2.1.7: The decision sitting and the rebuild spec

**Story:** As Omid, I want to decide the design in one sitting from the
study's documents, so that the rebuild has an approved spec to build from.
**Context:** spec §3.9. The six study documents are the sitting's input; its
output is the rebuild's design spec in this repo, at
`docs/superpowers/specs/<date>-rebuild-design.md`, with Omid's approval line
and milestone 1 (Initiative 2) as its acceptance target. From the study so
far (the Sprint 1 review, 2026-10-27): the sitting also decides milestone 1's
sealTag design, which Story 2.1.4 weighs (`docs/study/original-system.md`
§ What this means for the study), and the spec names the rebuild's top-level
layout, which Story 1.1.2 left to the study with a starting shape of
`hardware/`, `firmware/`, `software/`, `guides/` and `docs/` (#7; the
archive's Story 1.1.2 Context).
**Done when:** the spec exists at that path and carries `**Approved by:** Omid`
with the date.

#### Story 2.1.8: Close out Epic 2.1

**Story:** As the fresh-session closer, I want Epic 2.1 closed per KB
`epic-close-protocol` and the build initiatives filed, so that the rebuild
has its next plan.
**Context:** `node ../../scripts/close/close-epic.mjs --epic 2.1` from the
repo root, in a session that did none of the epic's work. Initiative-final.
The close files the build initiatives from the approved spec (spec §4):
hardware in KiCad 10, firmware, software, guides, and milestone 1's two-zone
demonstration — with D9's "set up the bench" story first (a tool tier plus
a cheap radio receiver to see what the boards transmit). Every hardware
story is proven by Omid's hand (D9): `requires: omid` teeth plus committed,
public-safe evidence — photos, measurements and the receiver's captures.
**Done when:** every manifest check passes or is adjudicated, the archive
entry carries the evidence block, Initiative 2 is cut whole, and the build
initiatives are filed in the same PR.
